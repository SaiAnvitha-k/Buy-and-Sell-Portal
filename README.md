# Buy-and-Sell-Portal
Buy and Sell Portal
The goal of this project is to create a completely functional e-commerce website where buying and selling can be done online.

The user of this website must first register by giving certain information about themselves. They must have a special username and must make up their own password in order to access the page.


The user will be taken to the home screen after logging in. The user can purchase the intended product on this website. On the home screen, the user can choose from the different product categories that are offered and purchase them.From there, they will be taken to the appropriate sites, where they must add the items they wish to purchase to their cart before placing an order and paying for it.
